# recombination
This project aims to tackle reassortment/recombination problems in phylogenetics. 
First, it tries to determine what level of genetic divergence is appropriate for building phylogenetic trees for influenza.

Branch master is specific for influenza reassortment. Branch recombining applies to pathogens, like MERS, which recombine rather than reassort.
